  <p class="introPara">Introduction to the body mass index(BMI)</p>
  <p>Body Mass Index (BMI) is a numerical value derived from an individual's weight and height, commonly used as a simple and quick indicator of body fatness and overall health. It is a screening tool that helps assess whether a person has a healthy body weight relative to their height.<br></p>
    <p class="introPara">How to calculate BMI</p>
    <p>
      I If you want to calculate your BMI, you have to find out your weight and height first. Once you know these values, you can arrive at the result by following the two steps mentioned below: <br>
      <ol>
        <li>Multiply your height by itself (height x height) in meters</li> <br>
        <li>Divide your weight by the answer you get in the first steps</li>
      </ol>
     <strong>It's important to note</strong>
       that BMI has limitations and does not directly measure body fat percentage or distribution. Athletes and individuals with high muscle mass may have higher BMIs without having excess body fat. Similarly, BMI may not accurately reflect health risks in older adults or those with certain medical conditions. <br> <br>
      Despite its limitations, BMI remains a widely used and practical tool for population-level assessments of overweight and obesity, helping healthcare professionals and individuals gauge potential health risks associated with weight status. However, for a comprehensive evaluation of an individual's health, additional factors such as waist circumference, body composition, and overall lifestyle should also be considered.
